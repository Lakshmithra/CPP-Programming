/*
    Procedural vs OOP â€“ Spark Analogy (Cooking)
    
    Procedural:
    Every time you cook, you gather ingredients, follow the recipe, and do everything from scratch.
    You manage both the ingredients (data) and the steps (logic) manually.
    
    OOP:
    You hire a personal chef. You give them the recipe once.
    From then on, they store the ingredients and handle the cooking when asked.
    
    Key Spark:
    Procedural = You do all steps every time (manual cooking).
    OOP        = Object (chef) stores and handles both data and actions for you.
